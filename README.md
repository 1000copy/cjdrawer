# Drawer Controller

`DrawerController` is a swift version of the popular `MMDrawerController` by [Mutual Mobile](https://github.com/mutualmobile/MMDrawerController).

Some minor changes in this version include the removal of all < iOS 7.0 related code and the use of spring animations instead of ease-in-ease-out animations. We've also added an animated `BarButtonItem` and plan to enable additional features for regular horizontal size classes (i.e. iPad and iPhone 6 Plus in landscape).

This is currently a work in progress and has not been thoroughly tested. Use at your own risk.
